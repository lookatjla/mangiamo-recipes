            <p>I love bread. White bread, wheat bread, cinnamon bread, banana bread, cheesy bread. None of these breads, however, hold a candle to the infamous garlic bread! So garlicky and buttery with that nice crispy outside and soft, chewy interior. It's the best pair that a soup, salad, or pasta could ask for (if they could talk, of course).</p>
        
            <p>Personally, I grew up on the frozen stuff. Hey! Don't judge me! It's all we knew in my household. Pop a couple of slices of the good stuff in the oven right on the rack and in 8 minutes, it was go time! Now that I'm older, I appreciate frozen dishes with short, pronounceable ingredient lists and unfortunately, most frozen garlic breads just don't make the cut. Luckily for me, I stumbled upon the best homemade garlic bread on the Internet! And because I'm so generous, I will share it with you, with a few minor tweaks of mine that make it absolutely knockout.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <h4>Roasted Garlic</h4>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF/200ºC.
                    </li>
                    <li>Slice the garlic head in half across the middle and place both halves onto a large piece of foil (large enough to wrap around both parts).</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the raw garlic with olive oil and lightly brush/rub it into the garlic cloves.</li>
                    <li>Seal the tin foil around the pieces to create a little "parcel."</li>
                    <li>Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes (30-40 is the standard for most ovens). At this point, the garlic should be a golden color and super-soft to touch. You can try and piece and then continue roasting if it isn't quite at your preferred level.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
    
            <h4>Garlic Bread</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the butter, garlic, Parmesan and parsley. Add the salt and generously season with pepper. Set aside while you cut the baguette.</li>
                    <li>Cut deep slits into the baguette, 1-inch apart — don't cut all the way through the loaf — and place the baguette on a large piece of foil. Using spatula, generously spread the seasoned butter inside each slit. Make sure to reach the bottom of the slit; don't be shy here.</li>
                    <li>Wrap the baguette in the foil, place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baguette from the oven and unwrap the top (leave the bread on the foil). Return bread to the oven and bake until crisp and golden on top, another 5 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife (or tear with your hands) and serve at once.</li>
                </ol>
