            <h1 class="title">Garlic Bread</h1>
            <p>I love bread. White bread, wheat bread, cinnamon bread, banana bread, cheesy bread. None of these breads, however, hold a candle to the infamous garlic bread! So garlicky and buttery with that nice crispy outside and soft, chewy interior. It's the best pair that a soup, salad, or pasta could ask for (if they could talk, of course).</p>
            <p>Personally, I grew up on the frozen stuff. It's all we knew in my household. Pop a couple of slices of the good stuff in the oven right on the rack and in 8 minutes, it was go time! Now that I'm older, I prefer to eat meals with as few unnecessary ingredients as possible and unfortunately, most frozen garlic breads just don't make the cut. After much trial and error, I have created one of the best homemade garlic bread recipes ever! Follow my steps and I guarantee you'll agree.</p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF/200ºC.
                    </li>
                    <li>Slice the garlic head in half across the middle and place both halves onto a large piece of foil (large enough to wrap around both parts).</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the raw garlic with olive oil and lightly brush/rub it into the garlic cloves.</li>
                    <li>Seal the tin foil around the pieces to create a little "parcel."</li>
                    <li>Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes (30-40 is the standard for most ovens). At this point, the garlic should be a golden color and soft to touch.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, stir together the butter, roasted garlic, parmesan, parsley, sea salt, and black pepper. Set aside while you cut the baguette.</li>
                    <li>Cut deep slits into the baguette, 1-inch apart — don't cut all the way through the loaf — and place the baguette on a large piece of foil. Using a spatula, generously spread the garlic butter inside each slit. Make sure to reach the bottom of the slit.</li>
                    <li>Wrap the baguette in the foil, place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baguette from the oven and unwrap the top (leave the bread on the foil). Return bread to the oven and bake until crisp and golden on top, another 5 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife (or tear with your hands) and serve at once.</li>
                </ol>
